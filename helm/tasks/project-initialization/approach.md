# Project Initialization Approach

## Task Overview
Initialize the Kindle Content Server project with proper tree architecture and fresh 2024 technology stack information.

## Approach

### 1. Research Phase ✅
- Gathered latest Google Cloud Run Flask deployment best practices
- Researched current Kindle KUAL plugin development methods
- Investigated Flask RSS feed to EPUB generation techniques
- Explored React Native Expo file upload solutions

### 2. Architecture Setup ✅
- Created `/project/` directory with proper tree structure
- Established five main modules: backend, frontend, kindle, infrastructure, shared
- Implemented required documentation files (rules.md, readme.md, patterns.md)
- Defined architectural patterns and data flow

### 3. Key Findings from Research

#### Google Cloud Run (2024)
- Host on 0.0.0.0:8080 for Cloud Run compatibility
- Use Gunicorn with timeout=0 for production
- Implement proper security with manual IAM role grants
- Leverage stateless architecture with external storage
- Use Cloud Scheduler for periodic tasks

#### Kindle KUAL Development
- WinterBreak method works on newer devices (5.17.1.0.4)
- KUAL extensions use simple directory structure
- MRPI required for firmware 5.5.x+ installations
- Active development community on MobileRead Forums

#### Flask RSS to EPUB
- feedparser + ebooklib combination proven effective
- Consider parallel fetching for performance
- Use content extraction (Goose3) for clean articles
- EbookLib provides comprehensive EPUB creation

#### React Native Expo
- Firebase Storage, Supabase, and Convex are top choices
- expo-image-picker + FileSystem.uploadAsync pattern
- Proper blob conversion required for uploads
- AsyncStorage for session management

## Next Steps
1. Set up individual module structures
2. Create module-specific documentation
3. Initialize git repository
4. Set up development environment
